        <p>Basically, almost a year ago I discovered coding/programming. In that time I have taken the Prework class
            for The Software Guild; which is lite HTML,CSS,JavaScript, and git. I then have moved onto programming
            in Java through The Software Guild's Program/Bootcamp. Programming is not coming as easy to me as other
            things;
            for example Business and Marketing(what my degrees are in). So I'm moving at a slower rate than the in
            person
            Bootcamp in MInneapolis, MN. I'm not giving up though. I love the finally being super challenged.
        </p>
        <p>
            In taking the Pre-course and then starting the Java training I realized how little I was actuallyt going
            to learn from my experience. No frontend, no other languages, no real other pieces of putting a web
            application together. On top of that, there was no computer science thinking or theory behind everything.
            I decided I had to look exlsewhere to really fill my knowledge base to become a full-stack developer.
